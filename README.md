# Arduino workshop

These projects have been programmed using Arduino IDE.

## First assignment - day0

Build a circuit with a red, yellow and green LEDs. Red and yellow should blink interchangeably. With a press to a switch, green should turn on and the previous LEDs will turn off.

Second part does similar, but this time red and yellow LEDs blink interchangeably.

Third part includes red LED additional blinking.

## Second assignment - day1

First part of the project consists of a LCD screen and potentiometer. With the help of latter, LCD should display current value which is being regular via potentiometer.

Second part (bonus) makes possible to enter current value via console instead of using potentiometer.

## Third assignment - day2

Task of this assignment is to make/improvise a light tracking device by using two servos and three photoresistors.
